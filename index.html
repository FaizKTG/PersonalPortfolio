                Software developer and game designer. I've always enjoyed works of art and aspire to
                use my ounces of creativity to develop projects for fun. I use Unity engine and have
                worked on 6 game-prototypes all either 3D or 2D, with one main game in-development. My main taste is that
                anything that has to be made must be made by me, which in-itself made my game development
                take a loooong time. With this stretched out time I've worked on drawing pixel-art 
                to be used in future games. I can also use blender and have made a few renders.
                Check out some of my listed projects below!

                RPG Gun shooter in development.
                My main project; It is a dungeon crawler and 2D shooter in a post-world war setting, 
                hidden inside a now forgotten and locked prison filled with spirits of fallen soldiers. The story
                follows a soldier who looks slightly ill. Game's code is programmed from the grounds up, All pixel art is designed by me.

                <div class = "TinyTitle">Blender Renders:</div>
                This is rendered in Cycles, it's basically my desk in real life minus a few items.
                There is my laptop, my lamp and of course my mug filled of coffee.

                This is one of the first renders I made as a way to introduce myself in blender, 
                I simply started like all with the legend Blender Guru himself followin his steps to 
                design this donut. Can't start right if you don't make donuts in blender.
